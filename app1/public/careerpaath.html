            <b style="font-size: 50px;">Career needs evolve, just like we do.</b><br><br>

            Career path definition is a process which requires continuous evolution. We’re constantly evolving 
            as individuals. Our career aspirations should change too. I remember that at the start of my career, 
            I was simply looking for growth opportunities.</p>
            
            <p>I wanted to learn something new and to do interesting work. And I didn’t want to worry too much about 
                my ultimate career landing spot. I was fortunate that technology consulting provided just that opportunity. 
                It enabled me to experiment and try different roles in search of my true passion.</p>
            
            <p>As I progressed, I started thinking more about specialization, career advancement and recognition. 
                At the same time, with two young children, work-life balance and flexibility became much more important. 
                I was also influenced by cultural norms. A demanding career is not always celebrated and women are often 
                still perceived as playing a dominant role in raising a family. As it turns out, I’m not alone.
                </p>
            <p>A surprising 57% of diverse women we spoke to were told to fit their career choices into the cultural 
                norms of their families, which often exclude a career in technology.

            <p><b>7 IT Career Paths and How to Get Started in 2023</b><br><br>

                Working in IT can mean a variety of different things. You can work in computer support, cybersecurity, 
                data, cloud computing, and other areas.<br><br>
    
                <img src="careerpath.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli" class="center"><br>
    
                It might be easy to assume that working in information technology (IT) means working in a tech office 
                in a big city. But that’s not the whole truth. Burning Glass Technologies found that over 90 percent 
                of IT skills and jobs are housed outside of the tech sector in the US. Non-tech IT jobs are also growing 
                faster than tech-sector IT jobs by over 50 percent—meaning that that gap is on trend to widen [1]. 
                Plus, IT skills are needed in places like hospitals, local governments, banks, and universities in 
                smaller cities across the country.<br>
    
                That said, the world of IT offers a variety of career paths in diverse industries. An IT professional 
                can specialize in cybersecurity to keep computers safe, cloud computing to make information easier to 
                access, or in help desk roles to assist in the everyday functions of an organization.<br><br>
    
                <b>IT career paths</b><br>
    
                Understanding what paths are available to you can help you navigate your first steps as you begin your 
                career in IT.<br>
    
                Not sure where to start? Many IT professionals begin in generalist roles that cover a range of issues, 
                like help desk technician or IT associate. You may get an entry-level IT certification to help you land 
                one of these roles, though it's often not required. Once you’ve gained some experience and have a better 
                grasp of what you like doing, you might think about focusing your career on a more specific area. You can 
                explore entry-level IT jobs to see what other routes you can take if you’re just starting out.<br>

                                on the IT help desk and work your way into one of these specialities.<br><br>
    
                <b>4. Software development</b><br>
                Software developers, or software engineers, create computer programs that are used to accomplish any 
                number of tasks—your internet browser, music streaming service, and online video conference app are all 
                examples of software. Software development can open paths into a variety of different industries, including 
                finance, video game development, and tech.<br>

                the field. Try starting with commonly requested ones like Python, Java, or Ruby.<br><br>
    
                <b>5. Web development</b><br>
                Working in web development means you’ll be responsible for creating and maintaining websites and phone 
                applications. Web developers can be front-end or back-end developers—that is, the front-facing interfaces or 
                behind-the-scenes mechanics of a website, respectively—or both. <br>
    
                <b>Salary:</b> $79,890<br>
    
                <b>Projected job growth:</b> 23% [6]<br>

                Python, JavaScript, CSS, or HTML—can get you oriented with the basics. From there, you can try building your 
                own website or application before applying to entry-level jobs.<br><br>
    
                <b>6. Data</b><br>
                With the ubiquity of internet-connected devices, companies have access to unprecedented amounts of data on 
                their customers, services, and other business factors. And though data isn’t a traditional IT specialization, 
                the increase in demand for data skills makes it a solid career option for those looking for IT-related work. 
                Working with data can entail keeping up hardware and security as a data technician, or sifting through data to 
                find patterns and insights as a data analyst or scientist.<br>
    
                <b>Salary:</b> $96,710<br>
