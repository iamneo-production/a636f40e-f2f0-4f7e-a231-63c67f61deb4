  Do you know that high-achieving women leaders are 1.5 times more likely than men at the same level 
  to think about downshifting or leaving their positions because of “burnout”? </p>
  <p>
  It’s a sobering thought for corporate organizations that has been brought into closer focus by 
  the additional pressures of the pandemic.<br></p>

  <p>Women in leadership positions often feel alone, lonely, even guilty because of the success they’ve 
  achieved professionally. Yet, most face substantial challenges establishing work-life balance in the
  face of incredibly busy schedules.</p>

  <p>Frequently, they benefit from help optimizing their input and influence both in the workplace and as 
  life partners, parents, and participants in their communities.</p>

  <p>With the right access to emotional support and accountability grounded in mutual understanding and 
    experience, they’re able to give more to the world professionally and philanthropically.</p>

  <p><b>10 Women Who Changed The Tech World</b></p>
  <p><b>1. Danielle Applestone</b></p>
  <p><img src="denielleapplestone.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli"><br>
    Danielle Applestone, founder and CEO of Daughters of Rosie, and former CEO at Bantam tools is working to
    bring women into the growing backlog of well-paying jobs in American manufacturing with a purpose for 
    advancement and benefit to address the labor crisis in the American manufacturing sector in. 
    She developed the Other Machine, a desktop CNC machine with user-friendly machine control software 
    funded by DAPRA.<br>
    Applestone grew up in the Arkansas woods, in a house built on tree stumps. Her mom grew vegetables and chopped all the wood. Her dad, a disabled Navy veteran who has used a wheelchair since he broke his back, was into making bullets. The family was always modifying things around the house so he could use or reach them. "For me, it was like, holy crap, tools are power," says Applestone.<br>
    But home life was rough. "There are ways to control your family with fear that don't involve punching them," she says. At age 8, she tried to run away. In sixth grade, a teacher referred Applestone--by then, a constant tinkerer--to a free STEM camp. At 14, she gained admission to a free STEM boarding school, and realized that science would be her ticket out.<br>
    By the time Applestone debuted the Othermill in 2013, she was a single mom who had managed to graduate from MIT and to earn a PhD in materials science. She turned down a job at Tesla, where she would have been the third employee in its battery division. Instead, she built a machine that she believed would teach Americans the skills necessary to take the two million manufacturing jobs projected to go unfilled over the next decade.<br>
    More sophisticated than both a laser cutter and a 3-D printer, the Othermill is a computer-controlled milling machine that can cut into aluminum, brass, wood, and plastic with incredible precision. Industrial mills can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and are the size of at least one refrigerator. Her team at Other Machine--now called Bantam Tools--had made a plug-and-play desktop version the size of a tall toaster that cost only $2,199. If a 3-D printer could let people make plastic objects at their whimsy, her milling machine could give people the power to produce the stuff that makes the stuff--anything from a circuit board to a gear.<br>
    "With a milling machine, the world is your Lego," says Applestone. Those at the forefront of the maker revolution believe "desktop milling has the potential to be even more significant than consumer 3-D printing," says Limor Fried, founder of Adafruit Industries, an open-source hardware company. Saul Griffith, founder of Otherlab, the San Francisco-based incubator where Applestone first hatched the Othermill, says any country that wants to stay ahead must empower the next generation with skills and accessible tools. "We have to give our children robots that make things," says Griffith. "Danielle is on the frontlines of giving robots to children so they can build the future."<br>
    Developing the mill had been challenging. But getting the money to do it was even more difficult. In 2012, an $8 million Darpa grant was supposed to fund Applestone's company, but only a fraction of it came through. To keep the project alive, Applestone and her staff took consulting jobs while mounting a Kickstarter campaign. Crowdfunding success attracted angel investors and venture capitalists, from whom she eventually raised $6.5 million. By the time fundraising was over, Applestone, now 37, felt indestructible. As a woman and as a hardware entrepreneur, she says it was "a nightmare. You come out on the other side of it, and you're friggin' strong. It's like, I can do anything now."<br>

  <p><b>2. Crystal Chao</b><br>
    <img src="Crystal Chao.png" alt="Italian Trulli"><br>
    Crystal Chao is AI/Robotics technology leader whose expertise in AI for human-robot 
    interaction including social robotics, conversational systems, design or visualization tool, 
    etc. She oversees a team at Huawei that operates in Silicon Valley, Boston, Beijing, and Tokyo 
    as the Company’s chief scientist and Global lead of Robotics Projects.<br>
    The goal of this work is to develop computational models of social intelligence that enable robots to work side by side with humans, solving problems and achieving task goals through dialogue and collaborative manipulation. A defining problem of collaborative behavior in an embodied setting is the manner in which multiple agents make use of shared resources. In a situated dialogue, these resources include physical bottlenecks such as objects or spatial regions, and cognitive bottlenecks such as the speaking floor. For a robot to function as an effective collaborative partner with a human, it must be able to seize and yield such resources appropriately according to social expectations. We describe a general framework that uses timed Petri nets for the modeling and execution of robot speech, gaze, gesture, and manipulation for collaboration. The system dynamically monitors resource requirements and availability to control real-time turn-taking decisions over resources that are shared with humans, reasoning about different resource types independently. We evaluate our approach with an experiment in which our robot Simon performs a collaborative assembly task with 26 different human partners, showing that the multimodal reciprocal approach results in superior task performance, fluency, and balance of control.</p>

  <p><b>3. Emily Cross</b><br>
    <img src="EmilyCross.jpeg" alt="Italian Trulli"><br>
    Emily Cross, a cognitive neuroscientist based her research using complex action learning
    paradigms, social interaction manipulations, and robots, in combination with brain imaging and 
    brain stimulation, to explore how brain and behavior are shaped by different kinds of experience.
    Currently, she works as the principal investigator for “Social Robots” 2016-2021.<br>
    Emily completed her PhD in December 2018. Her primary areas of research focus on the intersection between social attitudes and functioning within close, intimate relationships. Sexist attitudes pervade social interactions and play a powerful role in sustaining gender inequality, and intimate relationships potently affect health, wellbeing and wider social attitudes. Yet, research focusing on sexist attitudes has tended to ignore research examining intimate relationship processes, and research examining relationship processes has overlooked the important role of sexist attitudes. Emily’s research integrates these two important domains to show that (a) sexist attitudes have far-reaching effects on relationship functioning, and (b) relationship dynamics are fundamental to understanding women’s endorsement of sexist attitudes<br>
    For example, she investigates how hostile sexist attitudes impact aggressive and controlling responses within relationship initiation contexts, in ongoing established relationships, and during familial parent-child interactions. Her research also investigates how benevolent features of sexist attitudes are attractive and buffer relationship insecurities, including attachment insecurities because they provide distinct gender roles that can offer security and protection to those who need it.<br>
    Emily adopts diverse methods to capture the interplay between social attitudes and relationship processes as they unfold over the course of social interactions and people’s lives, including behavioural observation, daily diary and experience sampling methods, speed dating paradigms, and longitudinal designs to assess interpersonal processes as they naturally occur and influence people’s wellbeing and attitudes across time. These sophisticated methods are complemented by complex statistical techniques, such as multi-level and dyadic modelling.<br>
