  Do you know that high-achieving women leaders are 1.5 times more likely than men at the same level 
  to think about downshifting or leaving their positions because of “burnout”? </p>
  <p>
  It’s a sobering thought for corporate organizations that has been brought into closer focus by 
  the additional pressures of the pandemic.<br></p>

  <p>Women in leadership positions often feel alone, lonely, even guilty because of the success they’ve 
  achieved professionally. Yet, most face substantial challenges establishing work-life balance in the
  face of incredibly busy schedules.</p>

  <p>Frequently, they benefit from help optimizing their input and influence both in the workplace and as 
  life partners, parents, and participants in their communities.</p>

  <p>With the right access to emotional support and accountability grounded in mutual understanding and 
    experience, they’re able to give more to the world professionally and philanthropically.</p>
